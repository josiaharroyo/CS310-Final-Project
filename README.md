# CS310-Final-Project
The project will provide real-time transit data for CTA buses/trains in Evanston. The server fetches live data from CTA APIs, stores, and updates it. Computations include predicting arrival times using AWS SageMaker, filtering data to highlight the closest options, and recommending transit routes based on user preferences.
